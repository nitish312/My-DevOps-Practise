Introduction To Linux

üêßWhat is Linux
Linux is an operating system like Windows, but it's open-source, meaning anyone can use, modify, and distribute it for free.

There are many "flavors" of Linux, called distributions (distros), like Ubuntu, Fedora, and Debian, each with its features and design.

It is a reliable operating system used by millions of people and organizations around the world.

Linux Architecture ‚öôÔ∏è
Linux has a modular architecture in which distinct layers fulfil specific roles within the operating system.



Hardware: It includes CPUs, memory, disks and network interfaces.

Kernal: It's the heart of Linux OS which directly engages with hardware.

Shell: Command Line Interface acts as an intermediary between user and OS.

Applications: Includes various open-source software that can be directly installed.
